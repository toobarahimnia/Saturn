# The Planet Saturn

## intro
For this mini-project I have made use of ursina, that is made for developing games, as well as python language to creat a visualization of planet Saturn. The original idea of making such animation came from an honors research I have conducted during a semester in my undergraduate studies. 
what i made. what it does. how it works. how i made it.
